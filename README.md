Tools for advanced machine learning practitioners working with time series data

I've been meaning to add a portion of my function library that I can share publicly that would be useful for scientists working on time series with advanced machine learning tools.  Don't judge me for not doing that yet!  coming soon!  

Otherwise, I have to keep most of my code off of my account here.  Apologies for the snooze-fest of a Github profile.
